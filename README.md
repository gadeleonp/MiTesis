# MiTesis
The thesis was written in Spanish and can be downloaded from the Universities Library in this link: http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/08/08_0222_CS.pdf

This is the source code of my tesis. The tesis was published in the University web site. And was developed between January 2003 and October 2003 using the Rational Unified
Process, Universial Modeling Language, SQL Data Base and the three layer architecture model for web application. 
I programmed this source code for a project that was approved by the Professors at the School of Sciences and Systems Enginnering at the Facultyd of Enginnering of the 
Univeristy San Carlos of Guatemala (Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala) in Guatemala, Guatemala. 
This web application was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0. The ASP programming language and the C/C++ 6.0 programming language. 
The database was Microsoft SQL Server 2000. 
Originally this website was developed for the students but they later prefered using social networks. The data generated by this website is property of the University. 
The website architecture is 3 layers (data layer, front end layer and, business layer) that was the stanrd of that time. The technology was chosen by the professor of the 
University, my main activities where related to coding the website and explaining the process in my Thesis. 

This was my last project as a student and tought me a lot about the web applications methodologies and best practices at the time. 
Today we have more options for this kind of project and with open source, it will be easier to develop, upgrade and manage this kind of application.
